OO design for experimental game idea

The idea is a bit like Galaga, it's your ship versus unlimited formations of enemy ships with exponential power scaling.

How scaling works - two ships at one rank lower are an equal match together for a ship at one rank higher, etc.

Your ship's power scale is determined by the number of enemy ships you've destroyed.
